    <h1>Make your story!</h1>
    
    <p>You are in a fantasy world. You have a pet. This pet is a dragon. Your dragon is really large! The dragon one day stopped breathing fire! If the dragon does not get his fire back, he will die. Your goal is to choose the correct paths to go to in order to save your dragon. In order to do save the dragon, you must go to the Fire wizard. He will be able to make a potion to make your dragon breath fire again. Your journey starts when you leave your home. There is a forest that you have to cross first. When your journey starts, you see a gorilla. You look away from the gorilla. The gorilla doesn't notice you and your journey continues. </p> 
    <p>Time passes by, and you start to become very hungry. You look up and see 2 trees. In one of the trees there are groups of monkey with bananas. After seeing you, the monkeys become very scared and leave. But there is a very large monkey still on the tree. On the other tree, there is a group of berries. You go up the tree and eat the bananas. The large monkey is very friendly with you, and lets you eat the bananas. You eat a lot of bananas, leading you to be very full. You continue to walk, and you see the Fire wizard's temple not too far away. </p>
    <p>The next day, you continue to walk. You reached the Fire wizard's temple! You tell the Fire wizard that you need him to make a fire potion for your dying dragon. The wizard agrees to do this. He goes to get all of the ingredients for the potion. But there is a problem. He is missing one ingredient. The ingredient is a ruby. The wizard tells you that there is a cave nearby that has some gems inside. You go outside, but you also see a village that has many rubies inside. You decide to go to the village. In the village, the villagers immediately start to attack you because you were an outsider. They constantly hit you, leading to your death. You should have listened to the wizard. But your ignorance has lead you to your own death.Without the fire potion, the dragon has no fire powers, so he becomes really weak and dies.</p>
