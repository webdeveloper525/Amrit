    <p>You are in a fantasy world. You have a pet. This pet is a pegasus. Your pegasus is really large! The pegasus one day stopped flying! If your pegasus does not get his flying power back, he will die. Your goal is to choose the correct paths to go to in order to save your pegasus. In order to do save the pegasus, you must go to the Air wizard. He will make a potion that will make your pegasus fly again. Your journey starts when you leave your home. There is a mountain that you have to cross first. When your journey starts, you see a mountain lion. You run away as fast as you can. The lion immediately chases you and kills you.
