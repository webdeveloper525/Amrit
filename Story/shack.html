    <h1>Make your story!</h1>
   
    
   <p>You are in a fantasy world. You have a pet. This pet is a pegasus. Your pegasus is really large! The pegasus one day stopped flying! If your pegasus does not get his flying power back, he will die. Your goal is to choose the correct paths to go to in order to save your pegasus. In order to do save the pegasus, you must go to the Air wizard. He will make a potion that will make your pegasus fly again. Your journey starts when you leave your home. There is a mountain that you have to cross first. When your journey starts, you see a mountain lion. You slowly back away from it. The lion stops looking at you and continues to walk in a different direction. From climbing the mountain, you start to get really tired. You sit down on the rocks .This is when you see a wounded deer. You ignore it and start to walk away. You continue to cross the mountain. This is when you see the Air wizard's temple not too far away.</p> 
    <p>The next day, you continue to walk. You have reached the Air wizard's temple! You ask the Air wizard to make a potion for your pegasus that has stopped flying. He immediately goes to get all of the ingredients need for the potion. He immediately puts them in the pot and starts to stir. This is when the wizard dropped the one and only flask that he has. He orders you to go to a nearby shack which has many spare flasks inside. You go outside. You see the shack. The shack is in a very gloomy-looking swamp. You see that there is a nearby shop that sells glass items. You decide to go to the shack. There is no one in the shack. You immediately get the flask and run out of it. You go back to the temple and give the flask to the wizard. He puts the potion inside. You take your potion back home. Your pegasus drinks it, and he can now fly again! He also isn't weak anymore, and he is very powerful! You and your powerful flying pegasus live happily ever after!</p>
