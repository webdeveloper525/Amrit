    <h1>Make your story!</h1>
    
    <p>You are in a fantasy world. You have a pet. This pet is a dragon. Your dragon is really large! The dragon one day stops breathing fire! If the dragon does not get his fire-breathing power back, he will die. Your goal is to choose the correct paths to go to in order to save your dragon. In order to do save the dragon, you must go to the Fire wizard. He will be able to make a potion to make your dragon breath fire again. Your journey starts when you leave your home. There is a forest that you have to cross first. You see a gorilla. You immediately attack it, but the gorilla is much stronger than you. The gorilla pounces on you and kills you. Without the fire potion, the dragon has no fire powers, so he becomes really weak and dies. </p>
