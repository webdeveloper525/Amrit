    <h1>Make your story!</h1>
    
    <p>You are in a fantasy world. You have a pet. This pet is a dragon. Your dragon is really large! The dragon one day stopped breathing fire! If the dragon does not get his fire back, he will die. Your goal is to choose the correct paths to go to in order to save your dragon. In order to do save the dragon, you must go to the Fire wizard. He will be able to make a potion to make your dragon breath fire again. Your journey starts when you leave your home. There is a forest that you have to cross first. When your journey starts, you see a gorilla. You look away from the gorilla. The gorilla doesn't notice you and your journey continues. </p> 
    <p>Time passes by, and you start to become very hungry. You look up and see 2 trees. In one of the trees there are groups of monkey with bananas. After seeing you, the monkeys become very scared and leave. But there is a very large monkey still on the tree. On the other tree, there is a group of berries. You go up the tree and eat the berries. But it turns out that the berries were poisonous! You become very sick after eating the berries, and you die. Without the fire potion, the dragon has no fire powers, so he becomes really weak and dies. </p>
